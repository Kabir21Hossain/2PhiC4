Django is web application framework written in python programming language. It is based on MVT(model view template) design pattern.

it is also called battaries included framework because django provides built-in features for everything.

keyWords:

MTV=Model View template
ORM=Object Relational Mapping(interaction between database using python)


🔹 Key Features of Django
MTV Architecture (Model-Template-View)
Similar to MVC, but Django uses the terms:

Model – defines the database structure.

Template – handles the UI (HTML).

View – processes user requests and returns responses.

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
You interact with the database using Python classes instead of writing raw SQL.

Admin Panel (Auto-generated)
Django automatically creates a professional admin interface for managing site content.

Security
Django helps developers avoid many common security issues, like:

SQL injection

Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

Clickjacking

Scalability
It can handle high traffic and large data loads (used by Instagram, Pinterest).

Built-in Tools
Includes URL routing, form handling, authentication, sessions, and more.

```````````````````Virtual Environment```````````````(as soon as you have created a virtual environment, you will a find a folder in the location)



A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment where you can install packages and dependencies without affecting the global Python setup on your system.

* activate virtual enviraonment-
pip install virtualenv ( globally accessed)


--- now at any drive you can make an environment to work---


* check version
virtualenv --version

* naming an enviraonment
virtualenv my_env
OR
python -m venv <name of your environment you want to create>

* activate enviraonment
source ./my_env/Scripts/activate
OR
myenv\Scripts\activate(<you virtual environment name>\Scripts\activate)

*deactivating environment
deactivate



------ Django Installation-------

* check if Django exists or not
    python -m django --version

* if no module 'django' is known,then apply following procedure-

    i. create a virtual environment
    ii. activate it
    iii.now install django there(command: pip install django)
    iv.now check version of django(command: python -m django --version)

* if i get out of this environment(command:deactivate) i won't find this django module(command: python -m django --version) because 
it can't be globally accessed.

* If I want to access it globally, I have to install django outside the room(commad: pip install django).Now we can access it globally

* how uninstall django module :(command: pip uninstall django)

* how to show all pip list:( command: pip list)
* how to show any module(pip show <module name>)(example: pip show virtualenv,pip show django)



(extension in vscode: python,python extension pack,python indent,Django,django)
-------- First Django  Project-----(in terminal)
    1. django-admin startproject first_project # explanation: django-admin startproject <project name>
    # as soon as you have execute the first line, it will create a folder name first_project. Inside it you have a same name folder.Inside it you will find so many packages. (run manage.py file)
    2.cd first_project
    3.python manage.py runserver
    4. you will find a link in terminal ,click on it


----------first_project folder-----
        /                   \
                                \

    /
    first_project               manage.py

    - __init__.py(because this file ,python consider any folder containing this as python package)
    -  wsgi.py(web server gateway interface-is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web application synchronous)
    - asgi.py(asynchronous server gateway interface. Provides both asynchronous and synchronous)
    - settings.py(contains all the information or data about project setting.config info,template installed application,validators )
    - urls.py( url with application)
    - manage.py( project specific command line utility)

    unit of project = application(projects contains of application)

    ex:

    school management(project or folder)
                |
                | Teachers(appllication or apps)
                | students(")
                | Fees (")
                | courses(")
                
    * to create application or apps in a project
    command: django-admin startapp <app_name>




    ------- working with urls.py and views.py-----
    1. views.py and write code there
