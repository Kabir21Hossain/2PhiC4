Dynamic Programming states

1. Define states
2. define recursive relation
3. find solution for smaller sub problems


Dynamic programming of two types

1.Memoization Method(Recursive approach)
2.Tabulation Method (Iterative approach)

Memoization Method-
 
fun()
{
    1.handle base case
    2. if current state is solved,return the solution
    3.calculate the solution for smaller sub problems
}


Tabulation Method

main()
{
    1. handle the base case
    2.loop through the states
        find the solution for samller sub problems
        
    
}
